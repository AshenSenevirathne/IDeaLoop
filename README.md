#Problem Description:
Because of this Corona Virus Situation, people need to maintain their personal distance and it is very important to keep the personal distance while using public transportation.
Sri Lankan has declared a new set of rules for the people to follow till this situation over. One of the main rule is to limit the number of passengers travel in public transport services.
Public transport services are only allowed to travel passengers that match to the number of seats available. Since Public Buses are the main source of transport that used by the passengers,
they are facing a lot of problems. Most of the passengers have wait for hours to find a bus.
#Proposed Solution:
As a solution of the above problem, we are going to suggest an app which makes easy to do public transportation by bus. Through this app; people can book seats, view bus deatails, register as a pessenger or a driver, view available seats and can get where is the bus now etc.
