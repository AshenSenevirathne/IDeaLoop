#Problem Description:

Because of this Corona Virus Situation, people need to maintain their personal distance and it is very important to keep the personal distance while using public transportation.
Sri Lankan has declared a new set of rules for the people to follow till this situation over. One of the main rule is to limit the number of passengers travel in public transport services.
Public transport services are only allowed to travel passengers that match to the number of seats available. Since Public Buses are the main source of transport that used by the passengers,
they are facing a lot of problems. Most of the passengers have wait for hours to find a bus.

#Proposed Solution:

As a solution to the above problem, we are going to suggest an app which makes it easy to do public transportation by bus. Through this app; people can book seats, view bus details, register as a passenger or a driver, view available seats, and can get where is the bus now, etc. People do not wait in a queue to catch a seat, they can simply log in to this app and book seats. It will help to medical officers as well these days. Because they do not want to check if people are seated correctly by using 1m social distance or not. if there is any rule in the country currently, we can change this app according to them. As an example, there is a limitation for a bus as 25 passengers per bus. We can unlock only 25 seats and then users can only use those 25 bus seats and other seats cannot be booked. Like this, we can maintain our public transportation by bus using our BUS SEEK app.
